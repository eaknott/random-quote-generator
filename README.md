# random-quote-generator
Random quote generator coded with HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and custom Google Font 'Montserrat'.
This is a project to earn freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries certification.

This project can also be found in my works in CodePen:

**_How to Use:_**
This site generates quotes and their authors randomly from an array of inspiring quotes taken from various books on my shelf.

If you like the quote and would like to share it, you can click the 'X' (formerly 'Twitter') button on the bottom left of the quote box, and tweet it along with a hashtag "inspirationalquotes".

If you want to see another quote, click the "New quote" button on the bottom right of the quote box, and a new quote will appear along with its author.
Clicking the "New quote" button will also change the color scheme of the page.

I hope you enjoy some of the inspirational quotes I've shared in this project!
