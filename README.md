# Random Quote Generator

This is a random quote generator that displays a famous quote along with the author, randomly taken from a list of quotes.

## Description

This site generates quotes and their authors randomly from an array of inspiring quotes taken from various books on my shelf.

With each new quote generated and displayed, the screen's color also changes, with the color randomly selected from a list of colors.

This random quote generator is coded with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript. It uses the Google Font 'Montserrat'.

## Usage

There are two functional buttons:

- New quote button: for generating a new quote and color
- Twitter/X button: for tweeting the quote directly to the user's Twitter/X feed, along with the hashtag "#inspirationalquotes"

## Issues

- The first quote when page loads is always the same quote/author.
- The "X/Twitter" button does not fill in the quote and hashtag for the initial quote, only works after the "New quote" button is clicked
